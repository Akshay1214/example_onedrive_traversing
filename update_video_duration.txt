# # Assuming there is data in an excel file/existing excel file

# # Importing Libraries
# import openpyxl
# from openpyxl import load_workbook
# from openpyxl.styles import Font
# from openpyxl.styles import Font, Border, Side, NamedStyle

# # Data in excel 
# data = {'Name': ['Tom', 'Joseph', 'Krish', 'John'], 'Age': [20, 21, 19, 18]}
# filename = "Book1.xlsx"
# # Taking excel file
# workbook = load_workbook(filename)
# worksheet = workbook.active
# worksheet["A1"] = "Name"
# worksheet["A1"].font = Font(bold=True)
# worksheet["B1"] = "Age"
# worksheet["B1"].font = Font(bold=True)
# worksheet["I1"] = "Video Duration"
# worksheet["I1"].font = Font(bold=True)
# # Appending data to excel
# for record in list(zip(*data.values())):
#     worksheet.append(record) 
# # Saved file updated with data       
# workbook.save(filename)




# Step 2



# # Now appending data by finding last row to required column as mentioned here column = 6
# # Importing Libraries
# from openpyxl import load_workbook
# # Loading excel workbook
# myFileName=r'Book1.xlsx'
# #load the workbook, and put the sheet into a variable
# wb = load_workbook(filename=myFileName)
# # taking sheet from excel workbook
# ws = wb['Sheet1']
# #Max row is a sheet function that gets the last row in a sheet.
# newRowLocation = ws.max_row +1

# #Writing to the cell we need to update with data, specifying row and column, and value as we need 
# ws.cell(column=9,row=newRowLocation, value="data")
